# X Posting

A menubar-based macOS app for distraction-free X posting.

## Features (MVP)
- Draft from menubar or full composer window.
- DeepSeek polish with tone presets and output language option (`auto` / `en` / `cn`).
- Character limit analysis with automatic thread split preview.
- X API publish (single post or thread) with optional single image.
- Publish errors keep draft content so manual copy/post remains easy.

## Commands
- Build: `script/build.sh`
- Test: `script/test.sh`
